  <p> I'm a software implementation professional, data analyst, and composer. I've worked in the music industry for the Society of Composers & Lyricists, New York Philharmonic, and Lincoln Center. I train customers with pharmacy compliance software, configuring their applications and migrating data to the updated platform. I've actively developed my technology skills through coding projects and the Google Data Analytics Certificate. 

  
  <p> I've composed four stage musicals, including tech industry satire <i>South of Market: The Musical</i> and <i>Naked</i>, featuring a Manet painting whose nude model comes to life. My scoring for the screen includes indie video games and thesis films in Animation at the University of Southern California. My band Ruby Jubilee's self-titled album is available on streaming. I hold a B.A. in Mathematics and Music from Columbia University. </p>
